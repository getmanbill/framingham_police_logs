# police_logs
 Portfolio project showing pdf reads, pandas plotting, postgres.

 I'd like to get a better understanding of crime in my neighborhood, but the publicly available information only comes in pdf form. The purpose of this repo is to:
 
 - take pdfs downloaded from the Framingham police department
 - transform the files into usable data points for analysis
 - run some basic data exploration on the resulting files

These notebooks show proficiency with using python fo data wrrangling via pandas, regex patterns, file structures, and plotting.
